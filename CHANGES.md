## Development
- Added:
    - `union`, `subset`, `disjoint` and `equal_modulo` to complete set operations
    - `extend` allocates a bigger copy of a bitvector, `extend_inplace` - same, but may reuse the internal byte array
    - `mapi` as simple `map` requires external mutable state to do anything interesting
    - `to(_rev)_offset/bool_seq`, `to_offset/bool_iter` to process bitvectors as `bool` or offset streams and iterators
    - `of_offset_iter/seq` to construct 
    - `(rev_)iter`, `(rev_)iteri` and `(rev_)iter_seti`, `fold_left(i)` and `fold_right(i)`
    - Documentation to most of the public API
    - Relaxed set operations to be able to work with vectors of different length; missing bits default to zero
    - Better error messages for safe functions
    - New, more clear sexp representation
    - Builder pattern for vector construction from bool sequences and iterators
- Changed:
    - Interface style to be data-first
    - Embedded `Set` into the general API
    - Set operations names to be in line with `Set.S`
    - `set_all` and `create_full` now do not set bits which are beyond the vector length
- Internal:
    - Iteration methods are autogenerated from folds
    - Added iteration to and of words, folding
    - Redefined equality in terms of words (should have same semantics, given that `set_all` and `create_full` do not set all bits)
    - completely dropped `foldop1`, now using `foldi`
    - use `Bytes.make` instead of `Bytes.init`
- Fixed:
    - `popcount`, `is_full` and `is_empty`
    - Fix big-endian architecture compatibility
